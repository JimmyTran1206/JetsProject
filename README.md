# JetsProject

### Description
This project designs two classes to demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. The `FoodTruck` class hold the blueprint for a food truck, including its name, food type and rating. This class comes with private fields, setters, getters, full constructor, empty constructor, and overwritten toString method. The second class is `FoodTruckApp` that makes use of `FoodTruck` class to create a food truck fleet with variable length (not exceeding 5) based on user inputs. User can interact with the app by asking the app to:
- Print food truck information
- Print the average rating of all food truck
- Print the food trucks with highest rating
- Exit the program

### Tech Used
This project makes use of vanilla Java together with programming technique called encapsulation. The classes come with private fields and associated methods to access or modify these field. This technique gives enough access to object field and prevents undesired changes in object data.   

### Limitations
At this stage, the program assumes that the users make correct inputs and does not attempt to correct the user inputs by throwing exceptions and suggestions.

### Lessons Learned
Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) is a big concept including four main principles: abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. Java implement objects, data and functionality by organizing the codes into classes, fields, and methods. This projects demonstrate the encapsulation principles in OOP by using Java classes with private fields and various accessing methods.
